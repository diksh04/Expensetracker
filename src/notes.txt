* step-by-step approach is called imperitive approach(i.e we used in vanilla just)
while in react we use declarative approach
*custom based html elements are made with uppercase whereas default elements are made 
with lowercase like div,p,etc
*inside a componet we can only have one root element which we return
*components can't just use data stored in other components
* agar hume root tag ko functional component se krna hai toh hume root tag ki class aur 
functional component ki class ko add krna padega and sath mai functional component ke 
beech mai {props.children} likhna padega
*props stands for properties and are like attributes
*props are used to make code resuable and it allows us to pass data from another component
to this component
*useState fnc allows us to define values as state in which change will reflect
*if you have data which might change and where changes to data should be reflected
on the UI then we need state because regular variables can't do that(they don't revaluate
the whole component) and with state we can change and set values and if they do change
react will revaluate the whole component in which the state was registered and only that 
component
* two way binding means jis se hum data le skte and set bhi kr skte hai
